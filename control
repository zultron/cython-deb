Description: C-Extensions for Python
 Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
 easy as Python itself.
 .
 Cython is based on the well-known Pyrex, but supports more cutting edge
 functionality and optimizations.
 .
 Development of Cython is mainly motivated by the needs of SAGE.
